# THE BURN BOOK üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Mean Girls

### Team Members
- Member 1: Angitha S Pradeep - College of Engineering and Management, Punnapra
- Member 2: Arya Nair MP- College of Engineering and Management, Punnapra

### Project Description
This isn‚Äôt your average school notebook‚Äî this is the digital throne room of shade. 
Inspired by the iconic Burn Book from Mean Girls (2004), our online version takes the sass, the sparkle, and the savage to a whole new level.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Because sometimes,keeping all that tea bottled up is bad for the glow. The Burn Book is not just about drama ‚Äî it‚Äôs about expression.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Instead of passing around a crumpled notebook in secret, our solution makes the Burn Book digital, interactive, and totally anonymous .
So the tea is always hot and the shade is always on point
